You are analyzing a research paper titled "{{ paper_title }}". 

Below are all the figure captions from this paper:

{{ figures_text }}

Your task is to identify which figures are DIAGRAMS that show the paper's main method, architecture, framework, or system design. These are typically:
- Overall pipeline diagrams
- System architecture diagrams  
- Method framework diagrams
- Network structure diagrams
- Algorithm flowcharts
- Model architecture diagrams

Please classify each figure and return ONLY the figure numbers that are diagrams in this exact JSON format:
{
  "diagram_figures": [1, 3, 5],
  "reasoning": "Figure 1 shows the overall pipeline, Figure 3 shows the network architecture, Figure 5 shows the method framework"
}

Only include figures that clearly show the paper's main method or system design. Exclude:
- Results/experiment figures
- Comparison charts
- Ablation study figures
- Dataset samples
- Qualitative examples
- Performance plots

Be selective and only include figures that are essential for understanding the paper's core contribution.
