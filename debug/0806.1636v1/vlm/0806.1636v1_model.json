For, in practice, the background theory \\(\\varphi\\) is static, and the query \\(\\psi(\\bar{y})\\) small: only the database \\(\\Delta\\), which is devoid of logical complexity, is large and indefinitely extensible. Accordingly, we define the query-answering problem with respect to \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi(\\bar{y})\\) as follows: given a set \\(\\Delta\\) of ground, function-free literals and a tuple \\(\\bar{a}\\) of individual constants with the same arity as \\(\\bar{y}\\), determine whether \\(\\Delta \\cup \\{\\varphi\\}\\) entails \\(\\psi(\\bar{a})\\).

The computational complexity of (finite) query-answering problems is typically lower than that of the corresponding entailment problem in which all the components are treated, on a par, as input. From a theoretical point of view, it is natural to consider the special case where \\(\\psi(\\bar{y})\\) is the falsum. Taking complements, we define the satisfiability problem with respect to \\(\\varphi\\) as follows: given a set \\(\\Delta\\) of ground, function-free literals, determine whether \\(\\Delta \\cup \\{\\varphi\\}\\) is satisfiable. Likewise, we define the finite satisfiability problem with respect to \\(\\varphi\\) as follows: given \\(\\Delta\\), determine whether \\(\\Delta \\cup \\{\\varphi\\}\\) is finitely satisfiable."

This restriction is motivated by the prevalence of database query-languages, such as, for example, SQL, in which the simplest and most natural queries have precisely this form. By contrast, the choice of logical fragment for \\(\\varphi\\) is much less constrained: in principle, it makes sense to consider almost any set of formulas for this purpose.

We show that the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems with respect to any \\(\\mathcal{C}^2\\)-formula are in NP, and that the query-answering and finite query-answering problems with respect to any \\(\\mathcal{G}\\mathcal{C}^2\\)-formula and any positive conjunctive query are in co-NP. We show that these bounds are the best possible, and that the query-answering and finite query-answering problems with respect to a \\(\\mathcal{C}^2\\)-formula and a positive conjunctive query are in general undecidable. The data complexity of various logical fragments with counting quantifiers has been investigated in the literature (see, for example, Hustadt et al. [6], Glimm et al. [4], Ortiz et al. [9], and Artale et al. [1]). However, this is the first time that such results have been established for the large (and mathematically natural) fragments \\(\\mathcal{C}^2\\) and \\(\\mathcal{G}\\mathcal{C}^2\\).

Furthermore, by testing instead whether \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has a finite solution, we can determine the finite satisfiability of \\(\\varphi^{*}\\). The proof of Lemma 5 is relatively straightforward; that of Lemma 6 is more challenging, because it involves constructing a model \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) of \\(\\varphi^{*}\\), given only the frame \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) and its solution. It can in fact be shown that we may without loss of generality confine attention to frames whose size (measured in the obvious way) is bounded by a singly exponential function of the size of \\(\\varphi^{*}\\) (Pratt-Hartmann [11], Lemma 10). From this it follows that the problems of determining the satisfiability/finite satisfiability of a given \\(\\mathcal{C}^2\\)-formula are in NEXPTIME.

Without loss of generality, we may assume the star-types in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to be \\(\\bar{\\sigma} = \\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_{N'}, \\sigma_{N' + 1}, \\dots, \\sigma_N\\), where \\(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_{N'}\\) are the star-types realized in \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) by elements of \\(D\\), and \\(\\sigma_{N' + 1}, \\dots, \\sigma_N\\) are the star-types realized in \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) by elements of \\(A \\setminus D\\).

The above choice of \\(\\bar{w}\\) ensures that \\(\\bar{w}\\) satisfies \\(\\mathcal{E}'\\); to show that Step 5—and hence the whole procedure—succeeds, it suffices to show that, for all \\(k\\) (\\(1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant N'\\)) \\(w_k = n_k\\).

A good example is provided by the fragments considered in Calvanese et al.

Indeed, it is known that extending \\(\\mathcal{C}^2\\) or even \\(\\mathcal{G}\\mathcal{C}^2\\) with the ability to express transitivity of relations renders the satisfiability problem for this fragment undecidable. (Tendera [15] shows this in the case of four transitive relations; see also Gradel and Otto [5] for closely related results.) Notice in this context that the formula \\(\\varphi^{\\prime}\\) constructed in the proof of Theorem 3 is not in \\(\\mathcal{G}\\mathcal{C}^2\\), since it contains the non-guarded conjunct \\(\\forall xy(h(x,y)\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\bar{h} (x,y))\\). As we shall see in the next section, this is no accident: query-answering and finite query-answering are decidable with respect to sentences of \\(\\mathcal{G}\\mathcal{C}^2\\) and positive conjunctive queries. For an investigation of the data-complexity of satisfiability and query-answering in certain logics featuring both counting quantifiers and transitive predicates—and indeed of practical methods for solving these problems—see, for example, Hustadt et al. [6], Glimm et al. [4], Ortiz et al. [9]."
